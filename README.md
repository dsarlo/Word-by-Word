# word-by-word
The average individual can read around 200 words per minute. The goal of this application is to UNLEASH YOUR FULL READING POTENTIAL!

First, the text of some document will be obtained when the user takes a photo of it via smartphone or any other device/camera. The user can then upload their image to our application which will translate the photo to text via OCR, or Optical Character Recognition. 

The text will then be displayed back to the user one word at a time at a fast and constant rate, increasing the speed at which they are able to read the document. This process is known as “rapid serial visual presentation”, or RSVP.  The rate will be customizable, allowing the user to change the speed at which the words are relayed back to them. This makes their reading experience as fast and as efficient as possible.
